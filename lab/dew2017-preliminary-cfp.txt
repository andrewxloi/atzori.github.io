CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

Over the course of the last twenty years, currently emerging Web 3.0 environments have provided a strong potential for the integration of data sources, applications and tools. In such a pervasive and highly dynamic scenario, existing techniques for accessing and managing web content seem to be actually inadequate to satisfy the user needs and more implicit or automatic ways of joining information are needed to improve the usability of web resources where searching is often unwieldy. This raises several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. Such challenges range from the analysis of poorly structured information, such as annotations and tags, to the provision of innovative methods that support users in searching and integrating information offered by web resources.
These challenges are not limited to enhance information retrieval, but aims to raise awareness of how such information can be put to use in order to transform a specific dataset into a particularly significant resource when used in conjunction with other sources of information. 
The goal of the Data Exploration in the Web 3.0 Age (DEW 2017) IEEE track is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both the Academia and Industry working in the areas related to data exploration, in a very broad sense. The track welcomes contributions from data mining, query languages, data visualization, graph databases and other fields related to the analysis and exploitation of data. Papers focusing on Semantic technologies and Graph databases are particularly welcome.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
==================

Any work related to data exploration is welcome. The following is a non-exhaustive list to exemplify possible topics of interest:

  * Text and Data Mining, Knowledge Discovery
  * Faceted Search and Browsing
  * Information Retrieval
  * Data Visualization and UX for Web 3.0 data
  * Querying interfaces and languages including Constrained natural languages
  * Entity Recognition and merging, Type classification, record linkage and property ranking
  * Privacy and Security issues in Data Exploration
  * Machine learning and statistical methods for natural language and Web 3.0 data
  * Platforms and Applications exploring data in all domains including social, web, bioinformatics and finance
  * Knowledge graph creation, reasoning, and exploration
  * Data streams and the Internet of Things
  * Semantic Web and Linked Data analytics

  
SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS
===========================

Papers up to six (6) double-column pages (including figures, tables and references) should contain original contributions not published or submitted elsewhere and are to be formatted according to the IEEE template provided at the DEW 2017 website. Technical paper authors MUST submit their manuscripts through EasyChair in PDF format.
Accepted papers will be included in the proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press in a volume available under IEEE Digital Library. The proceedings will be submitted for indexing through INSPEC, Compendex, Thomson Reuters, DBLP, Google Scholar and EI Index, and available in both Elsevier Scopus and ISI Web of Science databases.
Distinguished quality papers presented at the DEW 2017 will be also selected for publication in internationally renowned journals.


IMPORTANT DATES
===============

  * Submission deadline: February 26, 2017
  * Notification of acceptance: April 2, 2017
  * Camera-ready submission: April 15, 2017
