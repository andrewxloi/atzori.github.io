# SWiPE: Searching WikiPedia by Example


## Introducing SWiPE
SWiPE is a research prototype interface that implements the _BESt Query_ paradigm ([WWW12 paper](http://www2012.wwwconference.org/proceedings/companion/p309.pdf)). 

It allows to better search Wikipedia, by using different parameters other than simpy keyword search.
SWiPE interface is looks like Wikipedia but you can click and search using infoboxes as if they were form fields to input constraints.
To discover active (recognized) fields, press Ctrl+Alt+1 or use the SWiPE Toolbar commands at the bottom of the screen. The Toolbar will also allow to search for text in the abstracts and to constraint the type of the required results (e.g., _Settlement_).

For instance, to search for all Italian cities with more than 2 million people, you can:

1. go to any page similar to the result you are looking for, for instance, go to the [Rome page](/wiki/Rome)
2. in the infobox, move the mouse over Italy, close to country, click and type =italy; similarly, go over Rome's population, click and type >2000000 (overwriting the existing value)
3. click on the green "SWiPE" button in the bottom Toolbar; now you will be shown a list of the larger Italian cities, as you asked!

Enjoy!
