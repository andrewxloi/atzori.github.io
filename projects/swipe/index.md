SWiPE: Searching WikiPedia by Example
=================================================================

Introducing SWiPE
-----------------
Thank you for using SWiPE!
This is an alpha version that implements our BESt Query paradigm applied to Wikipedia ([WWW12 paper](http://www2012.wwwconference.org/proceedings/companion/p309.pdf)). You can click and search using infoboxes as if they were form fields to input constraints.
To discover active (recognized) fields, press Ctrl+Alt+1 or use the SWiPE Toolbar commands at the bottom of the screen. The Toolbar will also allow to search for text in the abstracts and to constraint the type of the required results (e.g., _Settlement_).

Enjoy!
