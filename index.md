Short CV
--------
Maurizio Atzori was born in 1978 in Italy. He
graduated in Computer Science (Informatica) summa cum laude in
2002, from the [University of Pisa](http://www.unipi.it/). 
He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the [School for Graduate Studies "Galileo Galilei"](http://www.di.unipi.it/galilei/), University of Pisa, obtained in 2006. 
He has been member of the [ISTI-CNR](http://www.isti.cnr.it/), holding a research fellowship from [CNR](http://www.cnr.it/sitocnr/Englishversion/Englishversion.html) of Pisa, and a member of [Knowledge Discovery and Delivery Laboratory](http://www-kdd.isti.cnr.it/). 
He has been visiting scholar at [Purdue Univesity](http://www.cs.purdue.edu/) (Indiana, USA), working with Prof. [Christopher W. Clifton]((Ã¬http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/clifton) and his research team.
He has been visiting resercher working with Prof. [Yucel Saygin](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/ysaygin/) at [Sabanci University](http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/mdbf/eng/) (Istanbul, Turkey) and at [UCLA](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/), collaborating with Prof. [Carlo Zaniolo](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~zaniolo/).
Since December 2010 he is _Assistant Professor_ (Ricercatore Universitario, Professore Aggregato) at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](http://dipartimenti.unica.it/matematicaeinformatica/) of the [University of Cagliari](http://www.unica.it) (Italy).
His major research interests regard database and dataspaces, data integration, data mining and privacy-preserving algorithms for data management.

<!-- He discussed a thesis on Decision Trees and Abduction,
about the use of abductive inference with decision trees in the
context of classification.--> <!-- Since 2003 he is a <a href=
"http://www.di.unipi.it/phd/">PhD student in Computer Science</a>
