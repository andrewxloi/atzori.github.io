Computing Recursive SPARQL Queries
==================================

Introducing Recursion in SPARQL
-------------------------------

We developed a SPARQL function called `wfn:runSPARQL` that takes as a parameter a string containing a SPARQL query and executes it.
Such SPARQL query can refer to itself, enabling recursion and the use of any Turing-computable function within SPARQL.

Details and the online tool will be soon available here.
